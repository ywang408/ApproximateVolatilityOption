	abstract = {Statistical arbitrage identiﬁes and exploits temporal price diﬀerences between similar assets. We propose a unifying conceptual framework for statistical arbitrage and develop a novel deep learning solution, which ﬁnds commonality and time-series patterns from large panels in a data-driven and ﬂexible way. First, we construct arbitrage portfolios of similar assets as residual portfolios from conditional latent asset pricing factors. Second, we extract the time series signals of these residual portfolios with one of the most powerful machine learning time-series solutions, a convolutional transformer. Last, we use these signals to form an optimal trading policy, that maximizes risk-adjusted returns under constraints. We conduct a comprehensive empirical comparison study with daily large cap U.S. stocks. Our optimal trading strategy obtains a consistently high out-of-sample Sharpe ratio and substantially outperforms all benchmark approaches. It is orthogonal to common risk factors, and exploits asymmetric local trend and reversion patterns. Our strategies remain proﬁtable after taking into account trading frictions and costs. Our ﬁndings suggest a high compensation for arbitrageurs to enforce the law of one price.},

In fact the weakness of the traditional approaches does not depend on closed formula of probability density function which is explicitly unknown under this model. The advantage of Fourier transform technique is that for a wide class of stock price the only thing necessary to evaluate European call is a so called characteristic function since there is one-to-one relation-ship between a p.d.f \& ch.f and both of which uniquely determine a probability distribution. For accuracy and validation we implement pricing formulas FFT, Monte Carlo simulation and we compare both of them to the benchmark model BS.},

To capture the multiscale volatility of the ﬁnancial market, our model adds a fast scale factor to the well-known Heston volatility and we derive approximate analytic pricing formulas for the options under the model. The analytic tractability can greatly improve the eﬃciency of calibration compared to ﬁtting procedures with the ﬁnite diﬀerence method or Monte Carlo simulation. Our experiment using options data from 2016 to 2018 shows that the model reduces the errors on the training sets of the SPX and VIX options by 9.9\% and 13.2\%, respectively, and decreases the errors on the test sets of the SPX and VIX options by 13.0\% and 16.5\%, respectively, compared to the single-scale model of Heston. The error reduction is possible because the additional factor reﬂects short-term impacts on the market, which is diﬃcult to achieve with only one factor. It highlights the necessity of modeling multiscale volatility.},

@article{yeo_risk_nodate,
	title = {Risk control of mean-reversion time in statistical arbitrage},
	abstract = {This paper deals with the risk associated with the mis-estimation of mean-reversion of residuals in statistical arbitrage. The main idea in statistical arbitrage is to exploit short-term deviations in returns from a long-term equilibrium across several assets. This kind of strategy heavily relies on the assumption of mean-reversion of idiosyncratic returns, reverting to a long-term mean after some time. But little is known regarding the assessment of this kind of risk. In this paper, we propose a simple scheme that controls the risk associated with estimating mean-reversions by using portfolio selections and screenings. Realizing that each residual has a diﬀerent mean-reversion time, the ones that are fast mean-reverting are selected to form portfolios. Further control is imposed by allowing the trading activity only when the goodness-of-ﬁt of the estimation for trading signals is suﬃciently high. We design a dynamic asset allocation strategy with market and dollar neutrality, formulated as a constrained optimization problem, which is implemented numerically. The improved reliability and robustness of this strategy is demonstrated through back-testing with real data. It is observed that its performance is robust to a variety of market conditions. We further provide some answers to the puzzle of choosing the number of factors to use, the length of estimation windows, and the role of transaction costs, which are crucial issues with direct impact on the strategy.},

Introduction of this jump process adds three extra parameters λ , µ , and δ (to the original BS model) which give the users to control skewness and excess kurtosis of the P (ln(ST / S0 )) . Merton’s original approach for pricing is to use the conditional normality of MJD model and expresses the option price as conditional Black-Scholes type solution.

In comparison with all the previous approximation models based on the assumption of continuous sampling time, the current research of working out a closed-form exact solution for variance swaps with discrete sampling times at least serves for two major purposes: (i) to verify the degree of validity of using a continuous-sampling-time approximation for variance swaps of relatively short sampling period; (ii) to demonstrate that signiﬁcant errors can result from still adopting such an assumption for a variance swap with small sampling frequencies or long tenor. Other key features of our new solution approach include: (a) with the newly found analytic solution, all the hedging ratios of a variance swap can also be analytically derived; (b) numerical values can be very eﬃciently computed from the newly found analytic formula.},

The proposed method combines the advantages of both PDE and Monte Carlo methods and can be directly applied to models with more than two state variables. The pricing procedure is illustrated using a three-component index model that captures some of the key features of a diversiﬁed stock index over long time periods. The method is widely applicable and is demonstrated here in the general setting of the benchmark approach, where spatial boundary limiting conditions for the PDE need to be appropriately chosen and approximated. The PDE expansion is based on a Taylor series approximation for the underlying three-component PDE. A Monte Carlo method with variance reduction is then formulated to approximate the true solution. Almost exact simulation schemes are described for the given state variables in the model. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the eﬀectiveness and tractability of the proposed pricing and hedging methodology.},

	abstract = {Due to the presence of stochastic volatility dynamics, the Fong-Vasicek short rate model (see [3]) is more complex but also more realistic than the classical Vasicek version (see [12]). To enhance the numerical tractability of the Fong-Vasicek model for the calculation of bond option prices, we suggest the use of the HeathPlaten estimator (see [4], [5]) which performs excellently in the related Heston stochastic volatility model (see [2]). We show that the Heath-Platen estimator reduces the variance and thus the size of con dence intervals dramatically compared to a crude Monte Carlo estimation, which leads to a drastic speed-up in price calculations across di erent realistic parameter sets.},

For pricing discretely monitored variance swaps under a general class of jump–diffusion models, we propose a closedform expansion based on the length of monitoring interval. Our method relies on an iterative application of the Dynkin formula, which is usually called the operator method in financial econometrics. Numerical examples are given for demonstrating the efficiency of the method.},

	abstract = {The present article revisits the Diﬀusion Operator Integral (DOI) variance reduction technique originally proposed in [HP02] and extends its theoretical concept to the pricing of American-style options under (timehomogeneous) L´evy stochastic diﬀerential equations. The resulting Jump Diﬀusion Operator Integral (JDOI) method can be combined with numerous Monte Carlo based stopping-time algorithms, including the ubiquitous least-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) algorithm of Longstaﬀ and Schwartz (cf. [Car96], [LS01]). We exemplify the usefulness of our theoretical derivations under a concrete, though very general jump-diﬀusion stochastic volatility dynamics and test the resulting LSMC based version of the JDOI method. The results provide evidence of a strong variance reduction when compared with a simple application of the LSMC algorithm and proves that applying our technique on top of Monte Carlo based pricing schemes provides a powerful way to speed-up these methods.},

A number of well-known models perform poorly in the comparisons because of their implicit restrictions on term structure volatility. We show that these results have important implications for the use of different term structure models in valuing interest rate contingent claims and in hedging interest rate risk.},
