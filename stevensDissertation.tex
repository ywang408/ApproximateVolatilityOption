% Both dissertations and master thesis can be created from this program.  
% These fields should be changed:

% This template was created by Barbara Arnett, when she was part of the library staff
%
% update January 2009 - updated font size to 12p and added subsections to show up in the table of contents 
% update April 2009 - added optional dedication page, code courtesy of James Weatherall
% update May 2009 - added code to include the abstract, acknowledgment, dedication and vita to the table of contents.  As per Doris Oliver, everything except the title page copyright page, and table of contents should appear in the table of contents.
%
% update July 2009 - added code to pgnumchapter_nums.sty to have top of table of contents, figures & symbols start 1.5 inches from the top.
%
% update February 2010 - added \bibliography and BibTex file 
%
% update May 2010 - added line to ensure Table of Contents prints in normalsize font when run in Linux
%                            also changed copyright text to say C YYYY, name. All rights reserved.
% update February 2011 - removed line \renewcommand{\thesubsection}{\thesection\arabic{subsection}}
%            to allow toc subsections to print normally (see bea02152011)
% update 2014 Barbara Arnett, web services librarian, stevens institute of technology
%           is no longer maintaining the template - SIT library is not supporting the template anymore
%
% update March 2018 by Honglei Zhao at the time Ph.D. candidate in Financial Engineering 
%         - adding some packages commonly used in theses formatting. Comments are added to the right of the

% \section{Further Analysis}  

% \subsection*\normalsize\emph{Paper}
% The original copy of the dissertation must be produced on good quality 8 1/2$''$ x 11$''$, 20 pound acid-free white paper. The paper should not be stapled, punched, bound, colored or printed on letterhead.

% The two additional copies of the dissertation can be photocopied or produced on copier or laser paper.

% \subsection*\normalsize\emph{Ink}
% Black ink only is used to print your report.  If a graph or photograph contains color, that is fine. 

% Latex is used to help in the printing of formulas.   The following formula would be difficult to reproduce in Microsoft Word: 
%  \[
%         \frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).
%      \]

% This Report was produced by LaTeX\footnote {\LaTeX\ is a fun typesetting program. Single space is used in footnotes.} written by Barbara Arnett.  Barbara is not an expert with LaTeX, and anyone using LaTeX does not need to use this template.  It is simply provided to help with formatting, specifically with page numbers and images.  


% %this subsection heading below will not show up in the table of contents.
% \subsection*\normalsize\emph{Graphics} 

% Graph paper may be used for original drawings, charts or illustrations. Original drawings may be in color or black and white, however, color is allowed for illustrations only; all text must appear in black. The original thesis must contain the original graphic or illustration, not a photocopy of the drawing, graphic or illustration.

% If formulas and diagrams contain subscript and superscript characters, ensure they are large enough to read when printed in the final paper. 

% \begin{figure}[htp]
% \centering
% \includegraphics{3d-cone.pdf}
% \caption{3D Cone}\label{fig:3d-cone}
% \end{figure}

% Photographs
% Glossy prints of good reproducible quality, either black or white or color may be used. Photographs can be printed on 8 1/2$''$ x 11$''$ glossy finish paper, however, margin and page number requirements as stated above still apply for pages containing photographs. When attaching photographs to paper, double-sided tape may be used which causes the least amount of damage to the original paper. 

% Graphics that are oriented in a landscape position must be done in a manner that retains the page numbering in the upper right hand corner, as shown in figure 3.2.  This can be difficult in Microsoft Word, but it is possible.  To do this in Microsoft Word, create a new section, change the page to landscape, and place the page number in a text box.  The text box then is rotated on the landscape page.    Then begin a new section and resume portrait orientation.

% \includegraphics[height=5.0in, width=7.5in]{3d-cone.pdf}

% Glossy prints of good reproducible quality, either black or white or color may be used. Photographs can be printed on 8$''$ x 11$''$ glossy finish paper, however, margin and page number requirements as stated above still apply for pages containing photographs. When attaching photographs to paper, double-sided tape may be used which causes the least amount of damage to the original paper.

% The format of footnotes and the bibliography are to be prepared in accordance with standard practice in the field in which one is working. Documentation formatting style must be discussed with and accepted by the advisor. See further information on Reference Styles below.

% The suggested typeface for dissertations is 10 to 12 point Arial. Other suggested fonts are Times New Roman and Helvetica. Script and italic fonts should not be used except as needed in the body of the paper. Consistency should be maintained throughout the paper, using the same font for all text, diagrams, etc. on all pages.

% Electronic material, such as CDs and multimedia can accompany the dissertation. Each copy should be accompanied with a labeled CD. When bound, these are placed in an envelope in the back of the dissertation.  Oversized materials (pages greater than 8 1/2$''$ x 11$''$) can be included in the paper if necessary. Oversized pages should be folded so that 1$''$ on the left hand binding edge remains, allowing the page to be opened once the paper is bound.

% The reference style used for formatting the paper must be confirmed with your department and advisor. Frequently used styles are the APA (American Psychological Association), MLA (Modern Language Association) and AMA (American Medical Association) styles. Style guides and manuals are available for each style. Page headers are not to be used.
